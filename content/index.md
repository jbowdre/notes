title: A note about my notes
---
I'm using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) to publish some of the scripts, command snippets, and short reference pages that I've collected in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

These notes are primarily here for my own reference, but maybe you'll get something useful out of them too.

For code blocks with more words accompanying them, maybe take a look at my main blogs:
